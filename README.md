# DtmThroughputApp

How it works:

This code will run a Bluetooth DTM test, for 10 Seconds, the amount of time is determined by "DTM.TestTime.Value" variable at app.c. The DTM test parameters can also be configured at the initDTM() on app.c.



This code was based on the following Knowledge Base Article from Silicon Labs:

https://www.silabs.com/community/wireless/bluetooth/knowledge-base.entry.html/2018/01/08/ble_central_and_gatt-7cNE

The major difference here is the Central Piece operates in a Host Processor (Posix based host) connected to a Silicon Labs EFR32MG13P632F512GM48 running a NCP Bluetooth image.

This is intended to be used with the BLE Device Server example (https://github.com/claudioasfilho/BLEDeviceServer). The Android App mentioned on the KBA also works.


 It operates as a Central Device and it will search for a Demo Service  with UUID df6a8b89-32d1-486d-943a-1a1f6b0b52ed (Available on the Client side).

Once found it will connect to it and subscribe for a Notification Service UUID      0ced7930-b31f-457d-a6a2-b3db9b03e39a and it will read and write to another Characteristic UUID fb958909-f26e-43a9-927c-7e17d8fb2d8d.

Tools and SDKs:

This was tested with:

Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack 2.10.0.0

Gecko SDK Suite v2.4.0

GNU GCC Compiler: Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0
Thread model: posix


Development Board: Silicon Labs WSTK with BRD4159A (EFR32MG13P632F512GM48)

Usage:

In order to avoid modifying the Make File, please clone this to the following folder on the Bluetooth SDK structure.

/Applications/Simplicity Studio.app/Contents/Eclipse/developer/sdks/gecko_sdk_suite/v2.4/app/bluetooth/examples_ncp_host/

It should compile as is.

In order to execute it, please use the following command:

./exe/BLECentral /dev/tty.(Serial Port) 115200

If you desire to use this with a different Host, you will need to modify the Makefile in order to accommodate the cross compiler.

Target Device Images:

Both the NCP and Stand Alone Bootloader images can be found on the File Structure.

Stand Alone Bootloader - StandAlonebootloader-bgapi-MG13-combined.s37
Bluetooth NCP Image - ncp-MG13P.s37
